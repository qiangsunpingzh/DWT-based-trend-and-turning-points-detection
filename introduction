This ia a code for DWT-based trend and turning points detection (DWT-TTD) algorithm developed to identify trend and turning points. The algorithm include trend analysis from 
approximate components of discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and turing points detection from both detail and approximate components.

In this algorithm, the time series decomposition and choice of analytical scales are two important prerequisite foundations, the detailed explainations can be found in our paper

using this code, presentation of results of a given time series signal can use "print" or "plot". For a time series of image, we using both the DWT-TTD algorithm and Arcpy package
to achieve trend and turning points images
